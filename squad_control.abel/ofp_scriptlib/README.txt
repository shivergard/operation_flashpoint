Vektorboson's scripting function library for OFP/CWA 1.99

Version 1.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT:
This is a library of high performance functions for OFP/CWA. The functions are designed
to be parsed as fast as possible and use as few local variables and memory allocations as
possible.

This library uses the following prefixes:
- f_: functions
- c_: constants
- m_: math functions
- scf: vektorboson's OFPEC tag for assorted global variables

Most functions will work in OFP; functions which require CWA-scripting commands are marked
in the documentation. I may provide a OFP-alternative in the future where applicable.
Almost all functions are documented along with an example how to use them.
